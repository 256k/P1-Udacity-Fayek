notes from the P1 project reviewer:

no CSS inside of html (done)
css styles should be separated with a empty line (done)
no capitalization in any attribute or tag or value (done)
using double quotes " " instead of single quotes ' ' (done)
do not use measuring units when the value is 0. (done)


the html hirearchy for the gridding should be: container > row(s) > column(s) > content

use srcset for images

IDs are no preferred for targeting styles in CSS, it's better to use CLASSES
